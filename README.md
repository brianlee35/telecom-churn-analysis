# Telecom Churn Analysis

**Author**: Brian Lee

## Overview

For this project, various machine-learning methods were used to analyze and create predictive models for customer churn in a telecomunications company. The descriptive analysis of the telecom customer churn dataset show that specific factors have a larger influence on whether a customer wants to stay with the telecom company. The telecom company can use this information to retain more customers by addressing the factors that are causing customers churn from the company, leading to greater company profits.

## Business Problem

SyriaTel telecommunications company has hired us to analyze the causes to customer churn. Churn is whether a customer will stop doing business with the company. We are trying to predict the likelihood of a customer churn based on a user's communication usage, plans, and other related factors. SyriaTel can use these findings to improve the services to better keep customers and maintain greater profit for the company.

## The Data

This project uses the SyriaTel Customer churn dataset, which can be found in  `telecoms.csv` in the data folder in this repo.
